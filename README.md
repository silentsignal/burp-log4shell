Log4Shell scanner for Burp Suite
================================

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## [Video Demonstration](https://streamable.com/z1qkax)

Detailed description can be found [in our blog post about this plugin][1],
you can also [▶️ watch a recorded demonstration video][3].

Note about detection capabilities: this plugin will only supply the built-in
active scanner with payloads, thus for optimal coverage vs. performance, you'll
have to configure your scan properly – just as with any other built-in or
extension-provided scan. See [#3][4] for detailed explanation regarding this matter.

Comparison
----------

| Feature | Log4Shell scanner (this one) | ActiveScan++ ([`b485a07`][5]) |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Synchronous detection | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Asynchronous detection | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Hostname detection | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Username detection | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Ability for single-issue scan (see below) | ✔️ | ❌ |

Single-issue scan
-----------------

If you'd like to scan only for Log4j (and not other things such as XSS or SQLi),
this plugin makes it possible.

By following any of the instruction sets below, the scanner will only
perform Log4Shell checks on all insertion points if the scan configuration
created as a result is used.

### The easiest way ###

Thanks to Hannah at PortSwigger for bringing this to our attention.

1. When creating a new scan, click `Select from library` on the `Scan configuration` tab
2. Pick `Audit checks - extensions only` which is built into Burp Suite Pro 2.x
3. Disable every other extension (if applicable) that have an active scan check registered (such as ActiveScan++, Backslash powered scanning, Burp Bounty, etc.) so that only the Log4Shell scanner runs

### The easy way ###

This is the version that's demonstrated in the above linked video.

1. Save [`extensions-only.json`][2] to your machine
2. From the leftmost `Burp` menu, select `Configuration library`
3. Click `Import` on the right side of the window
4. Select the location where you save the file in step 1.
5. When creating a new scan, click `Select from library` on the `Scan configuration` tab
6. Disable every other extension (if applicable) that have an active scan check registered (such as ActiveScan++, Backslash powered scanning, Burp Bounty, etc.) so that only the Log4Shell scanner runs

### The manual way ###

This one used to be harder, but [@alright21 made it much easier][6].

1. Create a new `Scan Configuration`
2. Expand `Issues Reported`
3. Click on one of the issues to move the focus to that list
4. Press `Ctrl` + `A`
5. Right click on the list and click on `Enabled`, this will disable all issues
6. Manually check the box at the last one called `Extension generated issue` to enable that
7. Disable every other extension (if applicable) that have an active scan check registered (such as ActiveScan++, Backslash powered scanning, Burp Bounty, etc.) so that only the Log4Shell scanner runs
